            ProTrader Edge Limited operates on the principle that long-term success in trading is
            built on discipline, integrity, and professional conduct. This page outlines the
            ethical standards expected of our team, instructors, and students, and defines the
            professional culture we uphold.

              <h2 className={styles.h2}>Our Ethical Foundation</h2>
              <p className={styles.p}>
                ProTrader Edge Limited treats trading as a professional discipline, not a
                speculative activity. We reject shortcuts, hype, misrepresentation, and outcome-based
                promises in favor of process, accountability, and risk awareness.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.p}>
                Our standards are designed to protect learners, preserve the integrity of our
                educational environment, and maintain alignment with regulatory expectations.

              <h2 className={styles.h2}>Education-Only Standard</h2>
              <p className={styles.p}>
                ProTrader Edge Limited provides education and research only. We do not offer
                investment advice, trade signals, account management, or financial recommendations.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.p}>
                Instructors are prohibited from giving personalized trade direction, entry/exit
                instructions, or portfolio advice. All examples are strictly based on educational
                demonstrations only.

              <p className={styles.p}>
                We believe ethical trading education begins with honest risk disclosure. All students
                are taught that losses are part of trading and that no framework eliminates uncertainty.
              </p>
              <p className={styles.p}>
                We do not promote excessive leverage, reckless behavior, or capital misuse. Students
                are trained to trade only with risk they can afford to lose.
